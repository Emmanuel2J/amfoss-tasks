# INTROSPECTION
### Why must we choose you?
  I started coding in 11th. I started with python. It was very enjoyable. And at least to me, very easy. After 12th, when I started thinking about which career I should I go for, I thought about those lab sessions in 11th and 12th and how fun it was. Thats when I realized I should be a programmer, its fun, full of problems, and you get to cooperate with lots of people and have fun there too. I never heard about AMFoss before this, but it looked pretty cool and I liked that there were good oppurtunities here. I feel like, I would be very productive and (try to) complete all the coding projects you guys give me, because honestly, I don't think I can find anything better to do than code all day and finish a full project.
  
### What is your plan for the next 6 months?
  Well, coding related, I would probably make another app or two with flutter, because that was my favourite task and also because my dad is kinda forcing me to make one, he is saying we could make a huge online buisness with this and I am like please calm down Dad, I only made 4 pages with a button or two. So yeah, definetly many apps are going to be made. Other than that, I would probably try to learn Git a little better, because I am still kinda confused on some specific things.
  
### How would you contribute to back to the club?
  Like I said before, I am at your service, you guys can assign me any task at any time, I will help any way I can.
  
### Do you have any feedback for the selection process?
  Yeah, I like it. Its pretty good. Like whenever I have a doubt I ask the astronaut assigned to my planet, Geo, and he replies within 15 min every single time, and everytime, it was very helpful. I really appreciate that. Then other than that, I dont have any real criticism, this selection process was basically flawless. So thanks for taking your time and making it great.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  PS. I am not saying that just so I can get into this club. I genuinely think that. Like really Task-2 especially was a masterpiece.
