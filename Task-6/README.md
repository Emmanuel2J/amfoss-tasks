This was the first time I ever made an app. To be honest, it is the first time I ever used an object-oriented language. So there was a small learning curve, but after 3 days of watching tutorials I understood the basics. After that I checked the resources for this task and I saw there was something called an introductionpage package, and that really made this task much easier, I also looked up some tutorials for this introduction package but there were only 2, I think. But nonetheless, after 2-3 days I finished the app, there were a lot of issues along the way, but thanks to Google it wasn't a problem. Honestly, installing flutter in linux was the hardest part in all this. That alone took 2 days to solve, it was very annoying. Other than that, this was a fun task to do, and I will probably make more apps after this.
