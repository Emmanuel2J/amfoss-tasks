This is the first real task I completed and it was okay.  At first it was super simple, the linux commands were simple and easy to learn, so I finished the first few steps with ease.
Then I had to push it to the repo from the terminal. This was really annoying and difficult. I just couldn't understand all the tutorials in Google. I spent probably 30 minutes just searching youtube for how to push this into task 2.
Then I had and took a break. Then after I came back I closed every tab and searched very basic things and now I actually got answers for what I wanted. After that it was easy again. Then within the next hour I completed the full task.
So yeah an all around nice start
